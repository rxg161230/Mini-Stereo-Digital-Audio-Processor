# Mini-stereo-digital-audio-processor
 UTD's EE6306 required to make an application specific IC, the main aim of this project was the design and implementation of the MIni-stereo digital audio processor(MSDAP) was to present it as an example of low cost and low power IC to be used in a Hearing Aid. The performance of the MSDAP is expected to be the same level as that of two general DSP chips for implementing two-channel FIR digital filtering in audio applications which would reduce the cost by a factor of five to twn, ompared to a general DSP chips.
 
This VHDL top model is Xilinx ISE and Modelsim tested with the testbench taking in  given data from the course material to make shure the output data from the program matches the requirements stated in the project needs. 
There are various co-efficients used at several parts of the Finite State Machine to assist the input data to effectively handled.

The architecture that I designed and the way of implementation is given in the pdf provided and the subsequent files need to be imported into Xilinx or Modelsim to get accurate results.
